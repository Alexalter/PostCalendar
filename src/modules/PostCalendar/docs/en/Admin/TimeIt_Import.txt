# PostCalendar v8.0.0 TimeIt Import to PostCalendar

In the admin section there is a link for importing events from TimeIt into PostCalendar. The category of events is also converted to PC. Import can only be performed one time.

**Before proceeding make sure you have a good backup of your full database! Since categories are imported and the PostCalendar tables will be updated.**

After clicking the link to import events all TimeIt events are collected from the table {prefix_}timeit_events. Make sure that you table is named similarly. Every event is converted into a Doctrine object and inserted into PostCalendar. 
Fields that are converted are: duration, all day flag, repeating, location info, contact info, sharing and approval status.

### Categories
Every event gets the PostCalendar category _Imported_ and the original category assigned in TimeIt. The categories of TimeIt are assumed to be in registry TimeIt - TimeItEvents with property Main.

TimeIt categories are imported as a secondary category relation. If you wish to utilize those categories as the primary (or only) category relation, you may do so by doing the following:
   * Rename or delete the current 'Main' relation
   * rename the TimeItImport relation to 'Main'

After import the TimeIt event categories are removed from the old location in the categories_mapobj table.

The TimeIt version used for the creation of the import script was 2.1.1.
