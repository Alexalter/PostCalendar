Installation
========================================================================

	http://code.zikula.org/soundwebdevelopment/wiki/PostCalendar

PostCalendar 5.1.0 requires the (legacy) Topics module to function.
Please be sure that module is installed and functional before proceeding.

To install PostCalendar simply unzip/untar the distribution inside your 
Zikula modules directory. This will create the ./modules/PostCalendar 
directory and should contain all the files of the distribution.

Now, enter the administration portion of your Zikula site:

    * Select MODULES Administration
    * Click on the REGENERATE link
    * Find the PostCalendar entry in the list
    * Click INITIALISE
    * After the list reloads, click ACTIVATE

You should now have a fully functioning PostCalendar installation.

You'll want to enter your site's Administration and configure 
PostCalendar before you start to enter events. The installation 
will set defaults for the calendar so that it works, but in 
order to better suit your needs, it's best to change these as 
early as possible.

========================================================================
Upgrading
========================================================================
To upgrade PostCalendar you should first make a backup of you current
Database tables (using a tool like phpMyAdmin) and also backup your
current PostCalendar installation.  This will be useful in the event
an upgrade does not work for you.

Next, unzip/untar the PostCalendar distribution inside your Zikula
modules directory.  This will create the modules/PostCalendar directory
and place all the necessary files there.

Using the standard Zikula Module upgrade method, upgrade your module.

========================================================================
Menu Configuration
========================================================================
You can link to PostCalendar by entering {PostCalendar} in a menu block.

Using [PostCalendar] will also work, but this is for old style modules. 
Using the method above will produce much better results.

Goto your Block administration and edit/create the Menu block to hold 
your link to PostCalendar.

The Menu Block editing screen should look something like this:
 
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+ 
| Title        | URL            | Description | Delete | Insert | Blank |
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+ 
| PostCalendar | {PostCalendar} | My Calendar |        |        |       |
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+
