Installation
========================================================================

PLEASE ALSO READ THE DOCUMENTATION (possibly) AVAILABLE ONLINE AT

	http://code.zikula.org/soundwebdevelopment/wiki/PostCalendar

PostCalendar 5.1.0 requires the (legacy) Topics module to function.
Please be sure that module is installed and functional before proceeding.

To install PostCalendar simply unzip/untar the distribution inside your 
Zikula modules directory. This will create the ./modules/PostCalendar 
directory and should contain all the files of the distribution.

Now, enter the administration portion of your Zikula site:

    * Select MODULES Administration
    * Click on the REGENERATE link
    * Find the PostCalendar entry in the list
    * Click INITIALISE
    * After the list reloads, click ACTIVATE

You should now have a fully functioning PostCalendar installation.

You'll want to enter your site's Administration and configure 
PostCalendar before you start to enter events. The installation 
will set defaults for the calendar so that it works, but in 
order to better suit your needs, it's best to change these as 
early as possible.

========================================================================
Upgrading
========================================================================
To upgrade PostCalendar you should first make a backup of you current
Database tables (using a tool like phpMyAdmin) and also backup your
current PostCalendar installation.  This will be useful in the event
an upgrade does not work for you.

Next, remove the existing PostCalendar files completely (if they are there).
This is important because there are many extra files in the old installation
that should be removed.

Next, unzip/untar the PostCalendar distribution inside your Zikula
modules directory.  This will create the modules/PostCalendar directory
and place all the necessary files there.

Using the standard Zikula Module upgrade method, upgrade your module.

Notes for version 5.1.0
	1. There are no database changes from previous version
	2. The old method of PostCalendar 'themes' has been removed
			- you can accomplish the same concept using template-overrides in zikula
				see http://community.zikula.org/index.php?module=Wiki&tag=TemplateOverridng
	3. All colors are defined in the stylesheet now except category colors
			- you can override this with stylesheet overrides (same link as above)
